test frc joystick functions

This repository contains 3 simulators that take in joystick input from Logitech Extreme 3D (only tested on mac) for FRC
and attempts to move a 2D 2 wheeled tank drive robot on the screen. sim3 is the most recent version and contains
"UserCode.java" where you can enter your own code for the robot. Hopefully the physics is correct. You can also get 
encoder values and use it to practice autonomous code.
